# Prerequisites

## Hardware

- A Daikin Altherma or Daikin Altherma based heat pump (ROTEX, HOVAL Belaria...)
- An ESP32 or ESP8266 *I recommend an ESP32, more precisely the M5StickC, it has an integrated display, a magnet, fits well next to the board and is properly isolated. But any ESP32 should work. A support is added for esp8266.*
- 5 pins JST EH 2.5mm connector (or 4 Dupont wires M-F)

## Software

- Platformio

*That's all!*
